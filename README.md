# 2023COMP1030GP
2023 Comp 1030 Group Project

# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to allow the student to demonstrate their ability to integrate the  material they have studied during the COMP1030 course into a functional single java game application.

# Overall Deliverable

Using the java programming language you are to develop a simple computer game of your choice using only the constructs studied in the COMP1030 course.  Grading of the project is based upon the grading rubric below.

# Specific Deliverables

1.	A working application with no bugs, please submit a runnable file.
2.	A description of how the game is played and the goal of the game.
3.	A copy of the code in text form, black letters on white background. (not a screen shot of the code)
4.	A flow chart diagram for the game.
5.	A written summary of each class explaining its attributes and how it integrates into the game as a whole.


# NOTE:
•	Use only information and constructs found in the lecture slides. Do not use constructs from linked in learning if they are not found in the lecture slides 1-10.  
•	If your game is unique it must not already exist online.  However, if you choose to write a ubiquitous game such as checkers this is allowed, but your code must be unique.
•	Your code must represent a single game, not a set of simple multiple games like 5 different guessing games for example.
•	Each class must be a true object for your game and thus must integrate into your game as an object, not simply a class/object filled with code or static methods.
•	The main method can only contain a few lines of code (max 7) to jump start the program.
•	No more than 3 static methods can be contained in the game.
•	The instructor reserves the right to schedule an oral review if your submission appears, in any way, to be written or influenced by a third party, the purpose of the oral review is to confirm that you are the author of your submission.  Failure to demonstrate authorship of your submitted code will result in an academic misconduct which in turn will result in a zero in the test or a zero in the course.
•	Plagiarism is the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, plagiarised code will result in an academic misconduct and a zero in the test or course.
•	If a student submits advanced code or code similar to that of another student or code that does not adhere to course coding standards an oral review may be scheduled to validate authorship of the code.  If the oral review is not successful a zero will be awarded on that question and an academic misconduct will be filed resulting in a possible zero in the course.
•	The assignment is to be completed individually with only general guidance from other persons.
•	You must be the author of any code you write, authorship means that you thought up the solution framework, designed the code and authored the code, typing the code does not mean you authored the code.  Writing the code with help from another person or the internet does not mean you have authored the code.
•	Sharing the content of your submission with other students is prohibited; students who submit similar code may be subject to an academic misconduct.
